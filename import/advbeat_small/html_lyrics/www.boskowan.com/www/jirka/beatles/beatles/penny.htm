<p><strong><font SIZE="6">Penny Lane</font></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<i>(Lennon/McCartney) Lead Vocal: McCartney</i><br>
<br>
<br>
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs <br>
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know <br>
And all the people that come and go <br>
Stop and say hello <br>
<br>
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar <br>
The little children laugh at him behind his back <br>
And the banker never wears a mack <br>
In the pouring rain, very strange <br>
<br>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes <br>
There beneath the blue suburban skies <br>
I sit, and meanwhile back <br>
<br>
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass <br>
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen <br>
He likes to keep his fire engine clean <br>
It's a clean machine <br>
<br>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes <br>
Full of fish and finger pies <br>
In summer, meanwhile back <br>
<br>
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout <br>
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray <br>
And though she feels as if she's in a play <br>
She is anyway <br>
<br>
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer <br>
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim <br>
And then the fireman rushes in <br>
From the pouring rain, very strange <br>
<br>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes <br>
There beneath the blue suburban skies <br>
I sit, and meanwhile back <br>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes <br>
There beneath the blue suburban skies <br>
Penny Lane </p>
