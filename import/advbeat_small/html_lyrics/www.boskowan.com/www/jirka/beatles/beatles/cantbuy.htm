<i>(Lennon/McCartney) Lead Vocal: McCartney</i><br>
<br>
<br>
Can't buy me love, love <br>
Can't buy me love <br>
<br>
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright <br>
I'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright <br>
'cause I don't care too much for money, and money can't buy me love <br>
<br>
I'll give you all I got to give if you say you'll love me too <br>
I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you <br>
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love <br>
<br>
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so <br>
Can't buy me love, no, no, no, no <br>
<br>
Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied <br>
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy <br>
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love <br>
Owww! <br>
<br>
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so <br>
Can't buy me love, no, no, no, no <br>
<br>
Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied <br>
Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy <br>
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love <br>
Can't buy me love, love <br>
Can't buy me love </p>
