Rock music was still in early days at the time when The Beatles began recording in the early 60s, and they were therefore able to make a large difference in the way that rock music was shaped.  They broke many new grounds with both their music and styles, and created a previously unheard of mass hysteria in fans, often referred to as Beatlemania.   During their time together the released many singles which topped the charts, and many albums which crossed a variety of styles.

Never before or after in the history of popular music has their been such a large united following of a popular group, then that of The Beatles. The Beatles eventually stopped performing in live concerts, as the deafening screams from the crowd were too loud to play over, and the hysteria of the crowd was unsafe for all involved.  Therefore, they concentrated their creativity in the music studios.
