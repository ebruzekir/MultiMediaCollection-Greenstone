Lyrics:

    Em                                A7 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    C                             G  
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(Riff 1)

    G                        Em7        Bm           D7
You think you've lost your love when I saw her yesterday.
     G                  Em7        Bm              D7
It's you she's thinking of and she told me what to say.
             G                                    Em
She says she loves you and you know that can't be bad.
(Riff 2)
        Cm                                         D7
Yes she loves you and you know you should be glad. Oooh.

(Riff 1)

    G                Em7           Bm           D7
She said you were to know that she almost lost her mind.
     G                Em7         Bm              D7
And now she says she knows you're not the hurting kind.
             G                                    Em
She says she loves you and you know that can't be bad.
(riff 2)
        Cm                                         D7
Yes she loves you and you know you should be glad. Oooh.

(Chorus)

    G             Em7    Bm              D7
And now its up to you, I think it's only fair.
   G                 Em7   Bm           D7
If I should hurt you too, apologize to her.
             G                                    Em
Because she loves you, and you know that can't be bad.
(riff 2)
        Cm                                         D7
Yes she loves you and you know you should be glad. Oooh.

    Em                                A7 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
           Cm                 D7                  G   Em 
And with a love like that you know you should be glad
